<p id="artiststatement">	I'm an early starting artist, who grew up in southern California in Orange county. After high school I decided I wanted to leave my home and go study Graphic design in the Bay Area, as of right now I am currently studying at the University of San Jose. My whole life I have always been infatuated with different art styles and I would spend a lot of my time doodling and painting and most of the time dancing. My whole well-being is surrounded by the fact that I have the opportunity to be able to create and express myself in various styles. It was not till high school though where I had discovered that you can create digital art. In my junior year of high school I took my very first graphic design class. I was able to dip my toes within the digital world and work with programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe photoshop. I was amazed by what kind of things you could create on these applications. 
 As has everyone else has gone through, my family and the other adults around me in my life were always asking me “Oh college is just around the corner, what field are you planning to go into and what do you intend to do for the rest of your life?!” I thought to myself, okay aaliyah what do you like and what are you good at? As I reflected back all throughout my life, I came to the realization that what I truly loved and wanted to improve on was my digital art skills. So from then on I have been hooked and told my parents my plan and luckily they said they would support me. Even if it is a little scary to hear that your daughter is a “aRt mAjOr” but either way they intended to support me, and although I am still in the very beginning stages of my art journey and I am still working on different skill sets, good things in life take time. 
The art pieces I have chosen to display within my portfolio are from various points in my digital art journey to show how far I have come. Many of them vary drastically in style, and in subject matter. I am still trying to find my own style, but with each piece I feel like I get closer and closer to finding it. ANY TYPE OF GROWTH IS STILL GROWTH, hope you enjoy <3 </p>
